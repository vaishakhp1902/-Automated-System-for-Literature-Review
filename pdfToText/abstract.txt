Phishing is a fraudulent act to acquire sensitive information from unsuspecting users by masking as a trustworthy entity in an electronic commerce. Several mechanisms such as spoofed e—mails, DNS spooﬁng and chat rooms which contain links to phishing websites are used to trick the victims. Though there are many existing antiphishing solutions, phishers continue to lure the victims. In this paper. we present a novel approach that not only overcomes many of the difﬁculties in detecting phishing websites but also identiﬁes the phishing target that is being mimicked. We have proposed an anti—phishing technique that groups the domains from hyperlinks having direct or indirect association with the given suspicious webpage. The domains gathered from the directly associated webpages are compared with the domains gathered from the indirectly associated webpages to arrive at a target domain set. On applying Target Identiﬁcation (TlD) algorithm on this set. we zero-in the target domain. We then perform third-party DNS lookup of the suspicious domain and the target domain and on comparison we identify the legitimacy of the suspicious page.
